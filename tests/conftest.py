    This is the autograder. It works by checking the results of each test case
    (kept in tests/test_result.json), looking up the weight for each test case
    in tests/rubric.json. The output of the autograder is printed to the
    command line and logged to tests/rubric.json.

    tests/rubric.json has the following structure:
    {
        "name_of_test_case": {
            "weight": relative_weight_for_test_case_in_grading,
            "depends": [
                "list_of",
                "test_case_names",
                "that_this",
                "test_case",
                "depends_on",
            ]
        }
    }

    weight can be a float or an int, or it can be "required", a special string.
    When the test case is "required", the grade for the assignment is a 0 unless
    the given test case is passed. This can be used when checking for disallowed
    imports (e.g. importing sklearn to implement the assignment). The list kept
    in the "depends" will check the status of the listed test cases. If those test
    cases are not passed, the output of this test case will be disregarded when
    computing the grade.

    The autograder outputs to tests/report.json, which looks something like this:

    {
        "score": 0,
        "tests_passed": 0,
        "notes": {
            "test_load_data": "FAIL",
            "test_train_test_split": "FAIL",
            "test_f1_measure": "FAIL",
            "test_precision_and_recall": "FAIL",
            "test_confusion_matrix": "FAIL",
            "test_experiment_run_decision_tree": "FAIL",
            "test_experiment_run_prior_probability": "FAIL",
            "test_accuracy": "FAIL",
            "test_experiment_run_and_compare": "FAIL"
        }
    }

    It also prints to the console (this may not be seen if all tests passed),
    which looks like this:
